# PERSONALISATION FINAL PROJECT 

The project was inspired by the recent event, Eurovision, where contestant competing with a song in their native language instead of English would not rank very high. I am interested in understanding if this is a pattern elsewhere. 
This projects seeks to interrogate how and if the language used in a song influenced how the song will be recommended on the platform, Spotify. 

## Technical 

The project uses the Spotify API to authenticate and access the data for two user accounts registrered for the project. 
The library, langdetect is installed and used to be able to investigate the languages of the songs. 

This repository contains the .ipynb notebook, the report with the research question, analysis and conclusion as well as the data collected.
